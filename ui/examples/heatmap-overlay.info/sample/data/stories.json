{"content":[{"body":"The bulk of Typhoon Mitag's clouds and precipitation has been pushed north of its center, extending its reach over the East China Sea. Mitag was centered just off the coast of China's Zhejiang province when NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite passed overhead, but the bulk of the clouds were pushed north of center to the Korean Peninsula and southern Japan.\n\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard Suomi NPP provided a visible image of Mitag on Oct. 1, showing its eye was just off the coast of China's Zhejiang province in the East China Sea. The VIIRS image revealed some bands of thunderstorms wrapped around the partially-exposed, ragged low-level center of circulation off the China coast.\n\nThe main area of deep convection (rising air that forms thunderstorms that make up a tropical cyclone) and thunderstorms is located north of center and had decoupled from the center. That decoupled area of storms extended northeast to the Korean Peninsula and to Kyushu, the southwestern most of Japan's main islands.\n\nVisible imagery from NASA satellites helps forecasters understand if a storm is organizing or weakening. The shape of a tropical cyclone provides forecasters with an idea of its organization and strength. The more circular a storm appears, the stronger it can be. Because the bulk of Mitag's clouds and showers are pushed north of the center, it appears to be weakening. The image was created by the NASA Worldview Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.\n\nOn Oct. 1, the China Meteorological Administration posted several warnings including Typhoon Warning, and warnings for heavy rain. Those warnings can be found at: http://www.\n\nAt 5 a.m. EDT (0900 UTC) on Oct. 1, Typhoon Mitag had maximum sustained winds near 65 knots (75 mph/120 kph). It was centered near 28.7 degrees north latitude and 122.3 degrees east longitude, about 156 nautical miles south-southeast of Shanghai, China. Mitag is moving north. Forecasters at the Joint Typhoon Warning Center expect Mitag will turn to the northeast and pass over South Korea while weakening. It is expected to become extra-tropical in the Sea of Japan.\n\nHurricanes are the most powerful weather event on Earth. NASA's expertise in space and scientific exploration contributes to essential services provided to the American people by other federal agencies, such as hurricane weather forecasting.","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[124.9999513,29.00005],[125.0000513,29.00005],[125.0000513,28.99995],[124.9999513,28.99995],[124.9999513,29.00005]]],"type":"Polygon"},"id":326551501,"keywords":["CYCLONE"],"media":[{"format":null,"id":288114,"type":"image","url":"https://eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/web/212876_web.jpg"}],"publishDate":"2019-10-01T17:08:03Z","sourceId":2585,"title":"NASA satellite shows Typhoon Mitag's large reach over East China Sea","url":"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/nsfc-nss_1100119.php"},{"body":"BEIJING, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- China's national observatory issued an orange alert for Typhoon Mitag Tuesday, as it is expected to bring gales and torrential rains to eastern China.\n\n\n\tThe typhoon, the 18th of the year, is expected to make landfall at or pass by the coast of Zhejiang Province Tuesday afternoon or evening, the National Meteorological Center said.\n\n\n\tThe eye of Mitag was 28.2 degrees north latitude and 122.2 degrees east longitude, and it was moving at 20 km per hour northward with weakening power, according to the observatory's forecast at 1:00 p.m.\n\n\n\tThe observatory warned of strong winds and rainstorms in Shanghai and provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangsu.\n\n\n\tIt suggested people in affected areas avoid outdoor activities, and local authorities take precautions against possible flash floods caused by the downpours.\n\n\n\tChina has a four-tier, color-coded weather warning system for typhoons with red representing the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue.","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[[121.3290497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.3852985]]],[[[120.6144547,31.4459092],[120.6640327,31.4459092],[120.6640327,31.406982],[120.6144547,31.406982],[120.6144547,31.4459092]]]],"type":"MultiPolygon"},"id":326341296,"keywords":["CYCLONE"],"media":[],"publishDate":"2019-10-01T09:18:16Z","sourceId":5550,"title":"China issues orange alert for Typhoon Mitag - People's Daily Online","url":"http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2019/1001/c90000-9620034.html"},{"body":"China activated a level-IV emergency response for typhoon Mitag on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.\n\nTwo working teams have been deployed in the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian to assist local authorities for preparation.\n\nMitag, the 18th typhoon this year, is forecasted to sweep the northeast part of Taiwan on Monday night and move north to sweep or land in the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province on Tuesday.\n\nFrom Monday to Tuesday, Mitag is expected to bring heavy rain to some parts of Shanghai and provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangsu.\n\nThe ministry warned local departments to intensify real-time monitoring, issue alerts promptly, and strengthen evacuation and relocation in areas prone to flooding and geological disasters.","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[121.3290497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.3852985]]],"type":"Polygon"},"id":325749954,"keywords":["CYCLONE"],"media":[{"format":null,"id":287067,"type":"image","url":"http://n.sinaimg.cn/english/transform/116/w550h366/20190930/6db0-ifffquq2560726.jpg"}],"publishDate":"2019-09-30T02:57:10Z","sourceId":5806,"title":"China braces for typhoon Mitag - China News - SINA English","url":"http://english.sina.com/china/e/2019-09-30/detail-iicezzrq9331519.shtml"},{"body":"Beijing, Sep 29 (PTI) At least 36 people have been killed and as many injured in a road accident in east China''s Jiangsu Province, local authorities said on Sunday.\n\nThe accident occurred at around 7 am on Saturday, when a packed coach with 69 passengers collided with a truck carrying three people on an expressway, according to the rescue team.\n\nAn initial investigation showed that the accident was caused by a flat tyre in the coach, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nFurther investigation is underway, it said.\n\nRoad accidents are common in China, where traffic regulations are often flouted or go unenforced.

The meteorological radar project team was tasked with building a nationwide monitoring and early warning system for disasters such as storms and tornados. They explore the cause of disasters and seek ways to identify and issue early warnings for tornado-like weather. Compared with a conventional weather radar, the new system can more precisely detect dangerous, inclement weather by generating more reliable data, allowing local authorities to react more quickly to potential disasters. It can scan a potentially dangerous weather system in 90 seconds, whereas conventional radars take six minutes.According to the China Meteorological News, an official news outlet administered by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Jiangsu is the most frequently hit tornado region in China. According to CMA data from 1991 to 2014, 43 tornados hit China annually, and East China's Jiangsu Province and South China's Guangdong Province were hit the most.Severe tornados have also caused deaths and injuries in Northeast China's Liaoning Province and Central China's Henan Province this year.The new radar device installed in the city of Gaoyou in Jiangsu is undergoing tests, marking a key step in the \"tornado detecting radar research and development\" being undertaken under the country's research plan of \"natural disaster monitoring, early warning and prevention,\" according to the\ninstitute.

By Sunday, 23 people in the village have been confirmed dead after torrential downpours caused a landslide, blocked a river and submerged many homes.\n\n\"I heard a loud bang around 4 a.m. Saturday, and I climbed up to check and saw the first floor was already full of water. The water rose to the fourth floor in less than 10 minutes,\" said Pan Jianli, a resident.\n\n\"I was waiting for death and was so lucky to have been saved, but it's saddening to learn that so many of my folks have died,\" said Pan.\n\nXu Wenhai, a 59-year-old village official, was on his way back home when he saw the family of his neighbor trying to wade through knee-deep water and escape a crumbling house. He helped the children of his neighbors escape but did not have time to save the mother.\n\nIn Zhejiang, nearly 1.22 million people have been evacuated from their homes, and close to 5 million people were affected, said the provincial flood control headquarters.\n\nThe typhoon damaged more than 189,000 hectares of crops and 36,000 houses, and the direct economic losses reached 16.6 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars), the office said.\n\nLekima is expected to make a second landing along the coastline in Shandong late Sunday, packing strong winds and heavy downpours, the National Meteorological Center warned.\n\nShandong air traffic management bureau said the typhoon will greatly affect traffic in local airports.

The PBOC did say that it \"has t\nhe experience, confidence, and capacity to keep the renminbi exchange rate fundamentally stable at a reasonable and balanced level.\"Previous to this, during trade talks the currency has declined, but not past the RMB 7-per-dollar threshold. \nAccording to the Financial Times, the pattern of devaluation and increasing the value of the yuan to the dollar moved whichever way talks were going. Now with an extra 10% of tariffs, China has slid past the RMB 7 for the first time since 2008, looking to counter the effects last week's additional tariffs. \nTom Mitchell wrote in the Financial Times: \"It is also a reminder to the US president that when it comes to managing China's increasingly state-led economy in tumultuous times, Mr Xi has far more levers to pull than Mr Trump does in the US.\"","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[120.0452342,30.4089634],[120.3652342,30.4089634],[120.3652342,30.0889634],[120.0452342,30.0889634],[120.0452342,30.4089634]]],"type":"Polygon"},"id":303106819,"keywords":["MILITARYCONFLICT"],"media":[{"format":null,"id":251686,"type":"image","url":"https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/70533667/china-just-let-its-currency-fall-to-an-11-year-low-a-sign-beijing-is-ready-fight-back-in-trumps-trade-war.jpg"}],"publishDate":"2019-08-05T08:52:13Z","sourceId":14679,"title":"China just let its currency fall to an 11-year low - a sign Beijing is ready fight back in Trump's trade war","url":"http://www.businessinsider.in/China-just-let-its-currency-fall-to-an-11-year-low-a-sign-Beijing-is-ready-fight-back-in-Trumps-trade-war/articleshow/70533667.cms?utm_source=ten_minutes_with&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Content_Patnership"},{"body":"Several weeks after the launch of Shanghai's much-applauded compulsory waste sorting initiative, the eco-friendly policy has seen a not-so-green result, with a surge in plastic consumption that has left manufacturers struggling to keep up.\n\n\nSales of plastic bags and bins designed for specific types of rubbish have soared, while manufacturers in China's plastics producing hub, in neighbouring Zhejiang province, are working day and night to meet demand.\n\n\nWhile some industry insiders see this as a short-term impact of the new waste policy, others expect it to last for some time, due to the central government's intention to extend waste classification to more than 40 major cities across the country.\n\n\nOn Taobao, China's biggest online shopping platform, 3 million household rubbish bins were sold last month - or more than one per second - according to its own data.\n\n\nThe last week of June saw sales climb by half from the same period last year, it said. Taobao is owned by Alibaba Group, which also owns the South China Morning Post.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to data published by JD.com, Taobao's major rival, Shanghai sales of rubbish bins and bags between June 20 and June 30 on its platform rose by 105 times and 67 times, respectively from the same period last year.\n\n\nIn Taizhou, Zhejiang province, manufacturers have been operating at full capacity in what is normally their slack season. Alan Xu, a sales manager from Xinding Plastics, said the company had been extremely busy since late May as Shanghai prepared for the new rules, which took effect on July 1.\n\n\n\"The demand is so big that we don't have the time and people to make enough products and deliver them,\" he said. \"Our Shanghai regional manager normally brings in orders of 3 million yuan (S$594,595) a month and, so far this month, it's nearly 10 million yuan.\"\n\n\nXu said the company had halted production of its other plastic items, such as dog kennels, for the moment to focus on rubbish bins, making 7,000 to 10,000 a day to meet demand.\n\n\nBut he expected the surge to be temporary. \"Although 46 cities have been ordered to establish waste sorting systems, I don't think many of them can really make it,\" he said adding that, judging from past experience, not all city governments were as effective in carrying out policies as Shanghai.\n\n\n\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChen Kejie, who runs a plastic bag factory in Cixi, also in Zhejiang, said orders for waste sorting bags had doubled since late June and he expected demand to continue for a long time.\n\n\n\"People used to put everything into one bag. With the introduction of the new rules they need to put them into different coloured bags - for example, blue for recyclables and black for hazardous waste - so they definitely need more bags,\" he said.\n\n\nChen's factory makes bags in different colours according to official guidance, as well as some with printed labels specifying which type of waste they are for.\n\n\n\"There were some orders for such bags before, but only from government agencies and the demand was low. Since May, it's surged, generated by both government bodies and retailers,\" he said. \"After Shanghai, more cities are following suit as the central government pushes for waste sorting. So I think we will benefit from this campaign for a long time.\"\n\n\nChina is the world's second largest rubbish producer, generating 210 million tonnes of municipal solid waste in 2017, according to the World Bank's What a Waste database.\n\n\nPrevious attempts to tackle the problem by introducing waste sorting policies have failed, through a combination of people refusing to change their habits and a processing system that continued to mix different kinds of waste after collection.\n\n\nIn March last year Beijing set out plans for a standardised system with a target for 46 major cities, including Shanghai, to recycle 35 per cent of their waste by 2020.\n\n\nShanghai's new rules are believed to be the strictest so far, pushing waste producers to separate their rubbish into four types - household food, followed by recyclable, hazardous and residual waste. Companies and organisations face fines of 50,000-500,000 yuan, while individual offenders risk a fine of 50-200 yuan, if they don't comply.\n\n\nThe new rules have become a topic for national discussion in the past month and, for the first time, many people are changing their approach to waste.\n\n\nEric Liu, a Beijing-based senior toxics campaigner with Greenpeace East, said a rush on rubbish bins and waste sorting bags had been typical of previous pilot runs of waste collection systems in China.\n\n\n\n\n\"Too often in these new systems, officials just want to set up new bins with a fresh-printed sign and take a picture to show their bosses,\" he said. \"Of course it would be ideal if these new systems didn't trade one single-use plastic for another, but that change to reusable bags can be hard in the first step of a new system.\"\n\n\nDu Huanzheng, director of the Circular Economy Research Institute at Shanghai's Tongji University, said the sudden surge in waste bag and bin purchases was largely a result of the city's previous lack of environmental facilities.\n\n\n\"We know that, to ultimately solve the trash issue, we need to cut the production of waste in the first place. So more plastic consumption is not something we want to see, but I think it will drop when we install enough [facilities],\" he said.\n\n\nThe installation of waste management facilities was part of China's latest round of infrastructure building, Du said, comparing it to the country's investment in motorways in the late 1990s and the construction of high-speed railway in the late 2000s.\n\n\nThis article was first published in South China Morning Post.\u00a0\n\n\n\n      \n\n      \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    news POST\n\n    Purchase this article for republication.","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[[120.2850399,29.3472596],[121.997487,29.3472596],[121.997487,28.0144077],[120.2850399,28.0144077],[120.2850399,29.3472596]]],[[[121.101786,30.3308675],[121.421786,30.3308675],[121.421786,30.0108675],[121.101786,30.0108675],[121.101786,30.3308675]]]],"type":"MultiPolygon"},"id":298046541,"keywords":["MILITARYCONFLICT"],"media":[{"format":null,"id":245526,"type":"image","url":"http://www.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Jul2019/20190723_china-waste-management_Youtube.jpg?h=048697cd&itok=sQMOlvTz"}],"publishDate":"2019-07-23T09:04:49Z","sourceId":1960,"title":"Shanghai's war on waste leads to plastics surge","url":"http://www.asiaone.com/china/shanghais-war-waste-leads-plastics-surge"},{"body":"China Flood Death Toll Hits 61, Over 350,000 Evacuated: Ministry\n\n\n\n\n\nMohammad Ali\n\n\n(@ChaudhryMAli88)\n\n\n 18 seconds ago \n\n Fri 12th July 2019 | 03:03 PM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs many as 61 people have been killed and 356,000 evacuated from their homes as heavy rain and floods swept through large parts of southern and central China this week, Chinese rescue authorities said\n\n\n\n\nSHANGHAI (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 12th July, 2019) As many as 61 people have been killed and 356,000 evacuated from their homes as heavy rain and floods swept through large parts of southern and central China this week, Chinese rescue authorities said.In a notice published late on Thursday, China's Ministry of Emergency Management said 9,300 homes have collapsed and 371,100 hectares of farmland damaged during the floods, with direct economic losses now estimated at 13.35 billion Yuan ($1.93 billion).\nIt said more than 4,300 people had been rescued from floodwaters, which have affected regions stretching from Guangdong province in the southeast to southwest China's Chongqing on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river.During the summer, China routinely suffers from droughts in the far north and floods in the south. \nThe emergency ministry has warned that northern regions face even lower precipitation levels this year, while heavy rains are expected to raise flood risks on the Yellow river's upstream.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Thoughts and Comments","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[121.3290497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.3852985]]],"type":"Polygon"},"id":293966511,"keywords":["FLOOD"],"media":[{"format":null,"id":239039,"type":"image","url":"https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/media/2019/07/_3/730x425/pic_1562925808.jpg"}],"publishDate":"2019-07-12T10:05:18Z","sourceId":14575,"title":"China Flood Death Toll Hits 61, Over 350,000 Evacuated: Ministry","url":"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/china-flood-death-toll-hits-61-over-350000-667686.html"},{"body":"Aerial photo taken on July 10, 2019 shows water gushing out from the Jinxi Reservoir at Yongjia County in Wenzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province.

Sinopec will be supplying low-sulfur marine fuel at Zhoushan and other major domestic ports, while also estabilshing supply capabilities at more than 50 key international ports including Singapore. This commitment will help realize a 600,000 ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emssions, which is equivalent to ceasing the driving of 64 million trucks of the Fourth Stage National Vehicle Emission Standard (IV National Standard) for a year.\nShipping emissions have become a major source of air pollution in port cities and coastal areas. Statistics show that the amount of PM2.5 that a 10,000 TEU container vessel with 70% load produces is equivalent to what is produced by 210,000 IV National Standard trucks. In addition, research conducted on behalf of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) forecasts that the global shipping industry is estimated to consume approximately 300 million tons of marine fuel in 2020.\nUnder the revised MARPOL Annex VI, effective from January 1, 2020, the global sulfur limit will be reduced from the current 3.5% to 0.5%, representing an 86% decrease from current emissions. The new sulfur limit will prove revolutionary to the global shipping industry and as the limit help improve conditions of the global environment, it will also set up new challenges and opportunities to refiners in the industry. As a Category A council memeber of the IMO, China has taken a pioneering step in the initiative by bringing forward the starting date by a year and has implemented the sulfur limit in China costal areas since January 1st 2019.\nSINOPEC is commited to promoting environmental friendly developments in the global industry and has actively carried out production R&D on low-sulfur marine fuel since 2017. Going foward, ten Sinopec refiners located in costal regions will be carrying out the production of low-sulfur marine fuel. Of the ten refiners, three including ones in Shanghai, Jinling and Hainan, have already successfully produced IMO compliant marine fuel earlier this year. In terms of supply network development, supply networks have been established in ports in the Shanghai and Zhejiang region. SINOPEC aims to have all major domestic ports be equipped with steady and compliant supplies of low-sulfur marine fuel by January 1, 2020. In addition, Sinopec also aims to have establish supply networks of the fuel in up to 50 key international ports, including ones in Singapore, Hambantota and the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area.\n\"Reduction of shipping emissions is one of the key components of our Blue Sky Protection Campaign,\" said Mr. Lv Dapeng, spokesman of SINOPEC. \"The production and supply of low-sulfur marine fuel oil is a green initiative that benefits the whole world and one that requires collaborative global action.\"\nAs the world's largest oil refining company, SINOPEC has the advantage of owning advanced refining technology along with large-scale refineries located in costal areas where the market demand sits. This equips SINOPEC with the ability and to carry out large-scale production of low-sulfur marine fuel and contribute to the prevention and reduction of marine and air pollution in China and the world.\nSINOPEC has completed the development layout of low-sulfur greener marine fuel supply network globally. Mr.Liu Zurong, the executive director and party secretary of SINOPEC Fuel Oil Sales Co., Ltd (Sinopec Fuel Oil), said that SINOPEC Fuel Oil is a professional business arm expertise in global marine fuel business within SINOPEC.\nAccording to Mr. Liu, SINOPEC has completed establishing the layout of its global supply network for low-sulfur marine fuel, with the ability to supply from over 40 key overseas ports. SINOPEC adheres to its principle of \"every drop of oil counts\", and by putting great emphasis on strict quality control in production, SINOPEC aims to become a leader in setting industry standards for low-sulfur marine fuel.\nFurthermore, the Great Wall lubricate oil, a sub-brand of SINOPEC, has launched auxiliary products with OEM Certification that are compatiable with SINOPEC low-sulfur marine fuel.\nSINOPEC is commited to its low-carbon ecological development strategy, and views green energy as the key driver of environmental protection. In 2011, SINOPEC introduced low-carbon development concepts into its corporate strategies. SINOPEC has also taken the lead in publishing the Environmental Protection White Book among domestic refiners in 2012. In 2013, SINOPEC allocated 20.9 billion CNY to the \"Clear Water and Blue Sky\" initiative, an environment protection campaign which became the largest domestic one-off initiatve and managed to acheive significant social influence in China. In 2014, SINOPEC has launched the energy-efficiency enhancement program, which will ultimately help improve and maximize the company's energy utilization till 2030. Since 2016, SINOPEC Open Day has been introduced to the public, accumulating up to 3000 visits by its 65 sub-enterprises and accounting for 1.3 million visitors in total, making it the largest public open day activity in China. Since 2018, SINOPEC has rolled out the \"Ecological Enterprises Actions\", the largest domestic eco-action iniative that is applied to the whole enterprise value chain.

SINOPEC adheres to the principle of \"every drop of oil counts\", with strict quality control in production, making SINOPEC\u00a0a quality standard leader. \n\nFurthermore, the Great Wall lubricate oil, a sub-brand of SINOPEC, has launched auxiliary products in\u00a0compliance with SINOPEC low-sulfur marine fuel oil, which has obtained the OEM certification from international marine diesel engine manufacturers.\n\nSINOPEC\u00a0is consistently\u00a0committed to the low-carbon ecological development strategy and\u00a0assists with\u00a0environmental guardianship\u00a0by providing greener energy.\n\nIn 2011, SINOPEC introduced low-carbon development concepts into the corporate fundamental strategies. SINOPEC has taken the lead by publishing\u00a0Environmental Protection White Book among domestic refiners in 2012. In 2013, SINOPEC allocated 20.9 billion CNY into \"Clear water and Blue Sky\", a campaign\u00a0which involves the largest non-recurring provisions and has achieved significant social influence in China. In 2014, SINOPEC launched the energy-efficiency enhancement program, with the goal of ultimately realizing comprehensive improvement in energy utilization by 2030. In 2016, SINOPEC Open Day was introduced, accumulating up to 3,000 times and 1.3 million visitors in total among its 65 sub-enterprises,\u00a0becoming the largest public open day activity in China. In 2018, SINOPEC announced \"Ecological Enterprises Actions\", the largest domestic whole value chain enterprise eco-actions, through which SINOPEC will\u00a0further develop\u00a0into a clean, efficient, low-carbon and self-circulatory enterprise, to continue forging green and low-carbon development.\n\n View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sinopec-announces-goal-of-10-million-ton-low-sulfur-marine-fuel-oil-production-capability-by-2020-300862374.html\n\nSOURCE  SINOPEC","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[121.5238946,30.9103907],[123.3936224,30.9103907],[123.3936224,29.5137214],[121.5238946,29.5137214],[121.5238946,30.9103907]]],"type":"Polygon"},"id":279059350,"keywords":["MARINE"],"media":[],"publishDate":"2019-06-05T10:11:44Z","sourceId":8898,"title":"SINOPEC announces goal of 10 million ton low-sulfur marine fuel oil production capability by 2020","url":"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/June2019/05/c9875.html"},{"body":"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- World Bank issued the following news release:\n- climate change expected to increase flooding risks in one of China's poorest regions\nThe World Bank's Board of Executive Directors approved a loan of US$100 million to China today to foster regional collaboration, reduce flood risk and improve urban services in selected towns in the southern part of Shaanxi Province.

Then last week the US president announced sanctions against China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, saying the US would block the telco giant from buying vital American technology.\nThe US president in recent days granted a \u201ctemporary reprieve\u201d for Huawei \u2013 presumably to hold in reserve as another form of leverage in the broader trade dispute. But the announcement has already reverberated through the global mobile phone industry.\nEasing worries around the US-China trade dispute and the promise of no more Federal Reserve rate hikes had buoyed markets this year.\u00a0Bank of America-Merrill Lynch\nGoogle said it won\u2019t provide updates to its operating system for Huawei phones, and mobile phone carriers in Japan and the UK have pulled launches of the Chinese telco\u2019s handsets. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported this week that a British chipmaker has suspended its business with Huawei in response to the planned blacklist.\nOn the other side, my colleague in Shanghai reports that \u201ca wave of anti-US sentiment is sweeping over China this week\u201d as the country\u2019s leaders gear up for an extended dispute.\nThe trade wars have, unsurprisingly, had a chilling effect on the international exchange of goods and services. World trade began 2018 expanding at an annual rate of above 5 per cent, but this rate of growth plunged through the year and global trade actually contracted by 1 per cent through the year to March 2019, on Citi numbers.\nGlobal economic growth slowed sharply through the second half of last year, which sparked a near panic in financial markets. Tariffs didn\u2019t cause that slowdown by themselves \u2013 China\u2019s deleveraging program, the waning impact of Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus and the Fed\u2019s apparent commitment to keep lifting rates \u2013 played big parts. But the loss of confidence among businesses, the disruption to supply chains and the general heightened uncertainty associated with the US-China trade issue exacerbated this deceleration in activity.\nDespite all this, Wall Street stocks are a mere 3 per cent from their all-time peaks achieved earlier this year. In contrast, equities globally (excluding US shares) are down 15 per cent since trade tensions flared up in February 2018. American stocks, in comparison, are flat.\nWhat, then, does the market look like when it takes a more realistic view of these large, unpredictable geopolitical events?\nWell, currency and bonds markets are not so easily fooled.\nThe US stockmarket has retained its lofty heights, despite the intensifying trade conflict and declining earnings growth.\u00a0Hexavest\nFor example, a quick glance at the pound tells you all you need to know about how well the UK\u2019s tortuous Brexit negotiations are travelling.\nSisyphus has nothing on the task ahead of whoever replaces Theresa May as British prime minister in the coming weeks. An extension of the Halloween Brexit deadline seems destined to be extended in 2020 where a general election awaits.\nSterling has dropped in 12 of the past 14 sessions, and is down 4 per cent this month against the US dollar at over one-year lows. It\u2019s still off 14 per cent from where it sat before the UK referendum and is much nearer its lows than its highs.\nBack to trade, and the US dollar is up 10 per cent since February of last year, which might sound counterintuitive until you consider that the greenback tends to benefit from repatriation flows when investors get spooked.\nIn bond land, it\u2019s worth noting that the US yield curve inverted again earlier this month as the trade drama made headlines. A negative spread between the 10-year and three-month bond yields has predicted every American recession since 1975, although there are plenty of voices out there explaining why this time might be different (extraordinary monetary policy obviously being part of this story).\nIn any case, it is definitively not a good sign for the US economy. Wall Street should take note.","geometry":{"coordinates":[[[121.3290497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.3852985],[121.6490497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.0652985],[121.3290497,31.3852985]]],"type":"Polygon"},"id":273771003,"keywords":["MILITARYCONFLICT"],"media":[{"format":"JPEG","id":114514,"type":"image","url":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554296506137866%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/t_sharpen%2Cq_auto%2Cf_auto/eb71af0d8a0a527a0fac741a5233b7e319b1bbb8"}],"publishDate":"2019-05-23T05:34:16Z","sourceId":3967,"title":"Complacency rules as trade war threatens","url":"https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/complacency-rules-on-wall-street-as-trade-wars-threaten-20190523-p51qfq"},{"body":"Grain markets sometimes react in strange ways.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tThroughout the past year, as we have been \"negotiating\" with China to settle our trade dispute, the price of grains dropped pretty much from the first time the word 'negotiate' was mentioned in the same sentence as \"China\".\u00a0 The market apparently knew about the history of 'negotiating' with China.\u00a0 We negotiate, they win!\u00a0 And once again that was the case, as the past year we 'negotiated' and China was able to buy our soybeans first for a 10% discount, then a 20% discount, and now a 30% discount from what prices were before we started 'negotiating'.\u00a0 And we gave everyone else the same deal. \u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\tNow that we've bowed to the Chinese for the past year and its gotten us nowhere, we finally said \u201cno more negotiating\", and low and behold, the market bottoms!\u00a0\u00a0 Words are worthless it seems against communist China.\u00a0 Action (in this case more money from your bottom line) matters.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tLast Friday, tariffs effectively doubled against China, and Monday our market bottomed.\u00a0 Maybe 25% more tariffs on $325 billion isn't enough.\u00a0 Why not 50%?\u00a0 Or 75%?\u00a0 You can effectively tariff a country out of the competition for your citizens business.\n\n\n\n\n\tChina pretended to put tariffs on the U.S. products as well, including soybeans. But that was just a show.\u00a0 They apparently put a ban on purchasing from the U.S., and all but 2% of the buyers got the memo.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\tSo once the market realized the U.S. 'woke up', then the short position selling gig was over.\u00a0 But the next question is, \"Now what?\"\n\n\n\n\n\tCorn prices have rallied 26c, from their low yesterday to this mornings price, the strongest sign yet that we could have hit a bottom.\u00a0 For 200 bu/acre producers, that's $52/acre you lost if you were a seller yesterday morning vs. today - just 24 hours later.\u00a0 Yesterday, there wasn't a single bullish item on the table - everything was bearish and dark.\u00a0 We suggested in the am comments\n\n\tmaybe it was the bottom, as at bottoms it\u2019s always the most bearish.\u00a0 And yet, there is nothing bullish here to cite today, either, as there is no deal with China - our largest customer - on trade.\u00a0 So without that, nothing else matters, right? \u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\tBut when you consider that we've gone down for a year now, to the lowest price levels in years, then perhaps it does make a little bit of sense.\u00a0 Prices have dropped on the negotiations and then non-negotiations with China.\u00a0 Maybe the market understood that negotiations with China never were going to solve our problem, as negotiations with China (and even agreements) never do.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tInstead, the market seems more satisfied with action against China - something that does seem to work.\u00a0 Mr. Trump tweeted, this morning, that China should have taken their great deal instead of backing out (note the past tense?).\u00a0 Instead, the U.S. will buy its product from someone else, or make it domestically.\u00a0 That we didn't need Chinese products. The longer you wait, China, the worse the deal will be.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\tPerhaps that is something the Chinese can finally understand - and probably the only thing they can understand.\u00a0 When Pres. Trump tweeted about buying $15\n\n\tbillion of Ag commodities (at the new 30% discount) and give them to humanitarian aid targets, it was clear the U.S. was seeking another way to deal with excess production than to dream about an impossible deal with Communist China. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tWeather is not quite as favorable in the 14 day forecast, today, compared to yesterday. The forecast looks wetter in the Corn Belt the next seven days (above normal precip), as well as the western U.S.\u00a0 But the southeast U.S. still has below normal precip forecast, so that area will at least get some planting done.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\tTemps are forecast below normal in the northern third of the Corn Belt and the west the next seven days, but the rest of the U.S. (the southern 2/3) will enjoy above normal temps.\u00a0 Overall, some planting will get done in May, but northern areas look to struggle much more than southern areas.\u00a0 This is nothing at all like the 2018 year, when everything got perfect in May (just in time to allow optimal planting in warm soils). \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tPlanting progress is anemic, with corn only 30% planted (36% behind normal) and 10% emerged vs. 29% normally.\u00a0 Soybeans are only 9% planted vs. 29% normally, with cotton 26% planted vs. 32% normally.\u00a0 Sorghum is 24% planted (9% behind normal), sugarbeets 63% planted (17% behind), and oats 62% planted (21% behind).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\tHRS wheat is 45% planted (22% behind normal), barley 59% planted (13% behind normal) so its been horrible planting almost everything this spring.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tSoil moisture nationally remains wet, with 93% topsoil rated adequate/surplus (same as last week).\u00a0 Subsoil moisture is also 93% adequate/surplus - the same as last week as well.\u00a0 Soils just aren't drying much as its been relatively cold and wet - keeping planters out of fields.\u00a0 Now things are finally starting to move in mid-May, but already we are likely losing acreage to prevent plant as we just can't plant a crop in only 1/3 of our normal season (with normal weather).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tWe've lost a lot of time, and its likely we will lose a lot of acreage to prevent plant.\u00a0 How much acreage we lose depends on the late planting season weather.\u00a0 Can we get at least some of the lost HRS wheat and corn acreage planted to soybeans?\u00a0 Or will we lose a significant amount to prevent plant?\u00a0\u00a0 This makes the next 3 weeks at the end of the planting season extremely\n\n\timportant.\u00a0 It a bit ironic that perhaps for every million acres of prevent plant this year, is a million acres less the US needs to give away to \"humanitarian\" causes. \u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\tAbout the only bright spot for grain prospects is winter wheat, which continues to show improvement in yield potential.\u00a0 The Pro Ag winter wheat yield model rose another 0.21 bu/acre this week to 52.15 bu - which would be the second highest on record behind the 2016 crop.\u00a0 Overall, winter wheat loves cool and wet weather - and that's exactly what we have this spring (and thus why we can get much planted). \u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tRay can be reached at   is President of Progressive Ag Marketing, Inc., a top Ranked marketing firm in the country.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tThis material has been prepared by a sales or trading employee or agent of Progressive Ag Marketing, Inc. and is, or is in the nature of, a solicitation.
